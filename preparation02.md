Chelsea FC is my favorite football club, and this is a picture of them lifting the champions league trophy. Though i was not there, I was at my 
buddies lake house celebrating last year!

I am currently in the Data analytics graduate program. I went to Aquinas College for my undergrad, played soccer there for 4 years. Got my bachelors in
Business Administration with a minor in marketing.

I currently work full time for an SEO firm, we handle car dealership websites. I am currently a success manager, but looking to join their data team. Looking
for either a position as a data scientist or a data engineer.

This course is necessary for me to graduate. But this will be my first class coding in R, which is a lnaguage I would be able to use at my current company

I am really the first person in my friend group to go the analyst route, so I dont follow many people that post about data. However, I watch about 100 videos
on youtube about data engineering and what i would need to do, to become an engineer.

I love video games, rocket league is my favorite. I have a 10 month old australian shepard named Ferguson. I grew up on the east side of the state, but came 
over to west michigan for my undergrad and havent left since 2014 lol.
