**Estimated Time**

-   üéû Four Videos: 45 minutes
-   ‚òëÔ∏è Four Tasks: 20-30 minutes

## Introduction to Git and GitHub

### üéû Video 1: Introduction (13:43 minutes)

**Objectives**

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Explain the difference between Git and GitHub,
-   Create repositories in GitHub with a README file,
-   Create new plain text (`.txt`) and Markdown (`.md`) files within a
    GitHub repository
-   Edit and commit changes to files in a GitHub repository,
-   Provide informative commit messages, and
-   View commit history for a particular file.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1: Introduction

Create your own repo. You can [follow the steps
here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository)
(stopping once you reach the ‚ÄúCommit your first change‚Äù section). In
step 2, name your reflection `preparation01`. In step 4, you can choose
to make your repository private if you would prefer for your reflective
writing to private. If you choose to make your repo private, you will
need to grant me `@dykesb` [access to your private
repository](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13683056).

In this repository, *create a new markdown file* called
`kohn-reflection.md`. Notice that Daniel (video host) created a raw text
file (`.txt`), but I am asking you to instead create a markdown file
(`.md`). In this newly created markdown file, write a reflection (at
least a full page, at least 500 words, with multiple paragraphs) after
reading Alfie‚Äôs article. This should be a reflection, not simply
reporting what Alfie‚Äôs article says. Some prompts that you may find
useful are provided below, but feel free to make this reflection your
own!

1.  Describe a class where you felt your final grade in a course did not
    match with what you learned throughout the semester (this could be
    where your grade was ‚Äútoo low‚Äù or ‚Äútoo high‚Äù).
2.  What do you think grades represent? What is your experience with
    grades?
3.  If grades were removed from courses, what would you use for
    motivation? What value would learning have for you without grades?
4.  Describe a time where you took the ‚Äúeasy way out‚Äù for an assignment.
    Why did you choose to go this route?

This repository also contains a `README.md` file. Provide a brief
description of what your `preparation01` repo contains.

In the videos, notice that Daniel keeps referring to the ‚Äú`master`
branch.‚Äù While Git‚Äôs ‚Äú`master`‚Äù branch naming convention was likely from
the [‚Äúmaster
copy‚Äù](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html)
or ‚Äúmaster recording‚Äù use of the word, there also a history of
[‚Äúmaster/slave‚Äù](https://twitter.com/jpaulreed/status/1272038656799211521)
that has been used in many technology applications. The language that we
use matters. The term ‚Äúmaster‚Äù has an oppressive association, and there
are better, more inclusive words that we can use. [Beginning in
October](https://github.com/github/renaming), GitHub began using
‚Äú`main`‚Äù instead of ‚Äú`master`‚Äù for all newly-created repositories. I am
getting better at referring to it ‚Äú`main`‚Äù branch, but I might slip-up.
Also, I am aware that doing this is not going to solve the larger issue
and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. Some amazing
organizations/communities to support are [Data For Black
Lives](https://d4bl.org/), [MiR
Community](https://twitter.com/MiR_community), and
[RLadies](https://rladies.org/).

## Branches and Pull Requests

### üéû Video 2: Branches (11:54 minutes)

[![Branches](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oPpnCh7InLY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpnCh7InLY "1.2 Branches - Git and GitHub for Poets")

**Objectives**

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Create a new branch in a GitHub repository,
-   Switch between branches in GitHub,
-   Edit and commit changes to a separate branches in GitHub, and
-   Merge branches with a pull request.

Note that the network plot that Daniel shows throughout this video is
now located at üíπ Insights &gt; Network (on the left-hand toolbar)

### ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2: Make a branch and pull request

Create a new branch of your `preparation01` repository. Name this branch
after your favorite color (or any color).

In this new branch, **add** to your `README.md` by finding a link to a
[gif](https://giphy.com/) that speaks to your current feeling(s) and
include this as an image ([remember how to do this in
markdown?](https://commonmark.org/help/))

Create a **Pull Request** to your `main` branch from your new branch.

You are done working in this repository. For the remainder of this
Activity, you will work with other repositories in the `gvsu-sta518`
GitHub organization (linked below).

## Forks and Pull Requests

### üéû Video 3: Forks and Pull Request (12:22 minutes)

We will do more with pull requests in our first class session, but watch
this video to help prepare you.

[![Forks and Pull
Requests](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oPpnCh7InLY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4 "1.3 Forks and Pull Requests - Git and GitHub for Poets")

**Objectives**

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Describe what forking is in Git/GitHub.
-   Describe what a pull request is.

## Issues

### üéû Video 4: Issues and Markdown (11:31 minutes)

[![Issues](http://img.youtube.com/vi/WMykv2ZMyEQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ "1.4 Issues - Git and GitHub for Poets")

**Objectives**

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Respond to an Issue in a GitHub repository

### ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 3: Comment on an Issue

Find the issue titled ‚ÄúPreparation 1 Issue‚Äù that your instructor created
in the `community` repository. Reply to the question somewhere below.
Use *at least* two Markdown styling trick in your reply.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 4: Respond to another Issue

Find the issue titled ‚ÄúDay 2 Agenda‚Äù that your instructor created in the
`community` repository.

This issue currently includes my planned agenda for our second class
session. From the syllabus you saw that I want to encourage you seek
help in visible ways and the `community` repository is one way to do
this!

In this issue, post what was the muddiest thing from this Preparation.
If someone else already mentioned what you thought was muddy, give them
a ‚Äú+ 1‚Äù üëç.

You will continue to do this for each Preparation. This is one way to
ask me to discuss things at the beginning of a class session (and with
enough heads up, I can provide a better discussion). If, as your working
on non-Preparation material, you experience some ‚Äúmudd-iness‚Äù, create a
new Issue in the `community` repository! You can always ask questions
live during our class sessions.

**Optional**

-   Personalize your GitHub profile
-   Register for the (free!) [Student Developer
    Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) with GitHub
