# Kohn Reflection

I have never thought about a class and not receiving a grade. 
The only thing that comes to mind when I look at a syllabus is the grading scale the professor provides.
Would it really be the end of the world if schools stopped grading on a 4.0 scale of what students are told to learn, and instead give them
an opportunity to '4.0' on their own findings? After reading Kohn's passage grading may take the fun out of learning.

Grades have never really met that much to me. I was able to coast in most of undergrad and all of highschool and average a B letter grade. 
The courses I took out of pure interest were the easiest for me as I enjoyed learning the material. Classes such as general education courses, I
never really cared about. I would just do exactly what was told of me, never went above and beyond to learn anything other than the materials that
would pass me on the exam. 

Taking the easy way out in gen ed courses was extremely simple and exactly what I would do. There was set week to week reading, which I never did as there
was no assignment with it and the teacher would go over the reading for notes in class. There was no learning outside of reading from a book that was
assigned prior to entering the course. There was nothing stimulating about what the class offered, so all the material was quite honestly boring. 

I do beleive that if grades were removed from classes it would allow for a different 'flow' in the lecture style of many courses. If we were able to do our
learning on topics that interested us, instead of learning from a text book and being tested on memorization, I do believe school would be more fun.
Also grades always add pressure to students to peform well, and most of the time that takes the fun out of the class! Now I am not saying students should
just have a free walk, but they should be challenged on things that will help them get to where they want to go.

All in all, learning should not be based off simple memorization. I believe courses should teach students fundamentals but they should be able to explore
topics that interest them. Grades for some help keep them on course, others it doesnt bother, and some it may ruin their opportunity. Grades should be based
off learning and not memorizing text, and then forgetting it the next day after the exam is over.
